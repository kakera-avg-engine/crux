A cross-platform 2D graphic library for Kakera AVG Engine.

## What is it?

It's a cross-platform 2D graphic library like [Skia](https://skia.org/) and [Cairo](https://www.cairographics.org/), but gives user more control of rendering details. In this sense, it's more like [bgfx](https://github.com/bkaradzic/bgfx).

Notice: It **is not** an universal library but a customized library for Kakera AVG Engine, please ensure the library can fit your project before using it.
